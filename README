lightweight-smartpointer
========================

A lightweight smartpointer library for C++ that provides an easy and lightweight method to manage memory.
Best used with a custom garbage collection. (To do this, you must provide your own methods to get and dispose resources by overriding the private virtual methods in the abstract base class in "lightweight smartpointer.hpp". )
